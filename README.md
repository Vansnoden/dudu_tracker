# DuduTracker

A Software to Simulate and Understand Insect Movements over time and space. Dudutracker, 
is designed to simulate and comprehend insect movements over time and space, uses the 
principles of cellular automata. In the insect-related context, the cells can be in three 
potential states: unoccupied, colonized, or exposed. The software uses a 2D grid, with each 
cell having eight neighboring cells. The transition of a cell's state, which represents insect 
dispersal, depends on its current state and the states of its neighbors. A mathematical function 
determines the likelihood of insects colonizing a particular cell based on factors like food 
availability, suitable habitat, or favorable environmental conditions.
